# Machine-Learning
 
In this repository you will find all the work which I have done in Machine Learning.
I have structured the repository around the datasets, instead of machine learning topics. 

Please go through some of the concepts/techniques I have used

- __Initial Exploration:__
    - Basic statistical analysis for different features
    - Distribution for all the features
    - Visualizing the data using `matplotlib`

- __Data Cleansing:__
    - Impute the numerical values using `SimpleImputer`
    - Add new features using my custom class, `addAdditionalAttributes`
    - Scale the numerical values using `StandardScalar`
    - Encode the categorical values using `OneHotEncoder`

- __Data Transformation:__
    - Created numerical pipeline, combining all the numerical cleansing steps
    - Created categorical pipeline
    - Combined both the pipelines into one

- __Machine Learning Algorithms:__
    - Linear Regression
    - Decision Tree Regression
    - Random Forest Regression

- __Evaluation Methods:__
    - Root Mean Square Error _RMSE_
    - Cross-Validation

- __Fine Tuning the Model:__
    - Grid search
    - Randomized Grid search

- __Additional Topics:__
    - Combined Data Cleansing, Tranformation, Machine Learning steps into a single pipeline
    - Used Grid Search to fine tune the data cleansing steps

### Datasets used:
- California House Prices

### Futue Updates:
- I will now be working on MNIST dataset
- Learn Categorization algorithms and ways to evaluate the performance

### Note:
I am following [Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, 2nd Edition](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/). In my opinion, it is one of the best books I have come across for understand and learning Machine Learning, given you have some base knowledge and understanding about Python.

### [About me](https://preetparmar.github.io/)
I am a beginner in Machine Learning and always learning new things in python. Feel free to reach out with any suggestions, questions or just to say hi!
Also, look at my other repositories to see some of the projects I have worked on.
